    "**What does Soul Urge Number 1 mean?**\n",
    "Soul urge number 1 can reveal a lot about your heart’s desire and what makes you happiest in this life. As with all soul urge numbers, both positive and negative traits are manifested in soul urge number 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strong leadership abilities**\n",
    "As you may expect from ‘1’, this number demands independence, individuality and originality.\n",
    "You’re are a born leader, not a follower.\n",
    "Soul urge number 1 encompasses strong leadership abilities, creative talents and high standards.\n",
    "You can wield powerful energies with your strong will. Perhaps even bend situations and circumstances to get the results you’re after. You live life on your own terms. Such a fountain of high power energy makes it easy for you to manifest whatever you set your mind to.\n",
    "Soul urge number 1 enables you to make difficult decisions that others may shy away from.\n",
    "People trust your judgements and admire you. Some may even envy you. Most of them like to follow you. Make sure you are always in alignment with your own wisdom and the purpose of your soul to manifest these. And if you are willing to work hard, then success will come naturally to you.\n",
    "Whilst your heart and soul may want to lead, be mindful of your other numerology numbers and the influence they have over your life. Whilst your heart may want one thing, your destiny may want another and it’s key to find harmony and balance between your numbers. For a personal overview of all your core numbers, click here for a free numerology reading. It will help you understand your strengths, weaknesses, gifts, talents and abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Charismatic personality**\n",
    "Whether you’ve done it consciously or not, you may often find yourself at the centre of attention.\n",
    "This is because ‘1’ encompasses two very positive characteristics. While you do work hard and like to lead, you are also thoughtful of others. This is because, as a good leader, you feel a responsibility towards anyone who’s on your team. Besides, you have a compelling personality. You are original, and your demeanour demands respect, which often makes you the life of the party.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Infectious enthusiasm**\n",
    "You’re highly intelligent, which means that you don’t get excited about everything. You’re likely to research topics deeper than other people.\n",
    "You only commit to things you absolutely believe in. But once you do, you’re able to infect everyone with your healthy enthusiasm.\n",
    "As a true leader, you follow your own ideas in life. You like to make up your own mind, some of your views may be quite controversial. But it may appear so because other people have not properly looked into a certain topic. Others tend to appreciate the healthy dose of controversy. You’re able to enrich a debate with your unique perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidence vs. arrogance**\n",
    "The role of a leader is not without its shadow aspects.\n",
    "Often, as someone with 1 for soul urge, you may believe that you are the only qualified person in a group of people. This gives you the confidence you need to get people to follow your ideas. However, it’s worth remembering that not everyone wants to be led.\n",
    "Perhaps this is more true with your loved ones at home. Your leadership qualities may be unparalleled at work. But different rules apply at home. While you may be number 1 in your career, you may need to soften a little at home. You may have a rigid outlook on things but you need to soften a little. Be willing to compromise when it comes to intimate relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Competitive streak**\n",
    "You love to compete (partly because you know you’re convinced you’re going to win even before you’ve started). However, if you have soul urge number 1 in your name, you may struggle to contain your competitive streak from other people.\n",
    "It may bring out some negative parts of your personality and hinder your life path. Try to let go of winning sometimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Developing your authentic self**\n",
    "The leadership qualities of 1 are best expressed from a place of authenticity.\n",
    "You have an endless pool of creativity and innovation within you.\n",
    "If you have soul urge number 1, you have an inherent need to be a ‘trailblazer’ and go where others have not dared to go yet.\n",
    "Throughout life, it is important that you get in touch with your authentic self. This will help you to fully manifest the power of number 1. Once you discover your authentic self, you’ll be able to engage others to follow you. Otherwise, you may end up ruling with an ‘iron fist’ because your need to be a leader will manifest either way.\n",
    "Your authentic self maybe a little eccentric compared to other people. But that’s ok because you have such a magnetic personality that soon everyone will be on your side! If life knocks you down, you need to learn to quickly get back up on your feet again. And keep pushing yourself for those leadership roles. Don’t let fear hold you back – reach for the moon and land on the stars!\n",

    "**What does Soul Urge Number 2 mean?**\n",
    "Also known as the hearts desire number 2, this soul number carries an energy that’s almost in drastic opposition to soul urge number 1. Number ‘1’ is all about individuality, self-assertion and leadership. Whereas ‘2’ is concerned with balance, harmony and sensitivity. Every great leader needs a supporter in life — someone they can lean on and trust. Rather than being a leader, number 2 is more of the ‘sidekick’ type.\n",
    "2 values cooperation and friendship. Compared to others, they may prefer a submissive or subservient role in relationships.\n",
    "People with soul urge number 2 tend to be highly sensitive. They trust their feelings more than rational thought processes. And rightly so, because they have a powerful intuition. While they are social beings, they can be prone to introversion.\n",
    "Rather than desiring materialistic things, number 2s greatly value art forms of all kinds.\n",
    "They are moved by art, music, stories and films more deeply than other people.\n",
    "Love is an important aspect of life for anyone with number 2 soul urge. You could even say that number 2 is always on the look-out for the perfect partner. Not only in romantic relationships but other areas of life, including work.\n",
    "As with any soul urge number, 2 encompasses specific lessons that you came into this life to learn. And while 2 has many powerful attributes, it also comes with its own set of challenges. Anyone with this number must strive to overcome these challenges to learn the lessons which their soul has set out.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Devotion and passion**\n",
    "Number 2s are devoted and passionate people.\n",
    "They value love above material things and they have a strong need to be loved.\n",
    "Thanks to their unwavering devotion, they can be a real source of strength to their partners. They are usually happy to compromise in order to avoid conflict. These abilities can lead to a fulfilling long-term relationship. (Especially with the more dominant types.)\n",
    "2s may prefer the submissive role in relationships, shying away from the spotlight. However, always remember that your love is precious. Choose to place your love and trust in the right people. These are the people who appreciate and value your approach to life. If a friend or a romantic partner does betray your trust, you may feel like your very foundations have been shaken. This is because relationships are of paramount importance to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grappling with self-doubt**\n",
    "The heightened sensitivity that 2s experience can often lead to self-doubt.\n",
    "Due to their ability to anticipate the needs of others, they run the risk of becoming ‘people pleasers”. Their sensitivity can cause emotional imbalance, resulting in mood swings or excessive neediness.\n",
    "If you have soul urge number 2, you may undervalue your contribution and constantly compare yourself to others. You may also worry about whether people like you. Try to remember that those who really know you, value your abilities. While you may not be the dominating type, you are a source of strength to many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Powerful intuition**\n",
    "Sometimes you may wish that you were less sensitive compared to everyone else.\n",
    "But remember that your heightened sensitivity is the gateway into your remarkable intuition.\n",
    "On an intuitive level, you know how things work. In order to tap into your intuition, you need to let go of doubt and trust yourself. Utilising your intuition can also help guide the people you love.\n",
    "Those in leadership roles will value your wise counsel. Try to make some space to tap into your intuition on a daily basis. Journaling and meditating can help you do this. It may not happen instantly. But trust the process and you’ll soon be able to connect with your powerful intuition.\n",
    "The need for balance\n",
    "You are a born peacemaker.\n",
    "You have an innate need for balance in all things. That’s why you may often assume the role of a mediator when two friends or family members are fighting. You will strive to resolve the conflict in a way that leaves both parties satisfied. But the need for balance paired with your sensitivity may hinder you from expressing your true opinions. Especially when a heated debate arises. Trust your gut and trust that people will like you even if you oppose their opinions.'''"

    "If you’re willing to overcome these challenges, then you have every chance at living a successful and spectacular life.\n",
    "People with soul urge 3 need to find balance elsewhere in their lives. The desire for creative expression also needs to be tempered with the ability to nurture and look after yourself.

    "People love your wit and sense of humour.\n",
    "Those with soul urge number 3 are born entertainers and very personable. However, at times, your mastery of words may go into overdrive. This can happen either when you’re nervous or when your ego gets the best of you. Remember that it’s ok to slow down in social situations.\n",
    "\n",

    "People with soul urge number 3 are very creative.\n",

    "People with number 3 gain immense pleasure from pursuing a goal. So it’s all the more vital for 3s to pick a creative path and stay focused on it. 3s also tend to struggle with carrying out their projects to the end. They need to learn how to apply discipline and consistency to their work.\n",
    "Grappling with self-doubt and criticism\n",
    "Once you have picked a path that you wish to follow, you may become your own worst enemy. People with number 3 in their soul urge can struggle with self-doubt and criticism.\n",
    "3s may also be prone to overthinking situations that wouldn’t baffle others. That’s only because 3s have such a strong focus. Apply it wisely to your projects, and not your self-doubt.\n",

    "The number 4 represents stable foundations. Picture the square upon which the great Egyptian pyramids were built.\n",
    "The master numerologist Hans Decoz describes the energy of 4 as masculine. “His chief characteristics,” he writes, “are dependability, productivity, punctuality and obedience.” These qualities are manifest in people with soul urge number 4.\n",
    "For them, hard work is everything, and they are goal-orientated. They also have a keen sense of justice.\n",
    "People with soul urge number 4 do well in their careers. They may even work in fields related to law and order.\n",
    "They do have a need to do work that is charitable or fights for justice on some level. Physically, they tend to look neat and clean. Since they enjoy regular exercise routines, they are strong and healthy.\n",
    "The bottom line is, soul urge number 4 represents stability and practicality. As with any soul urge number, 4 comes with its positive attributes and its challenges.\n",

    "You have an inherent need for stability and structure. You are willing to work hard. Thanks to this and your methodical and stable approach, you are a rock for any business.\n",
    "Promotion comes easy to you, and you thrive in hierarchical environments. (For instance, the corporate world.) The need for stability manifests itself in your relationships with others, too.\n",
    "Your loved ones can always rely on you. You’re always on time and you have no problem taking on more responsibilities. Your house is usually in order, and you approach chores as methodically as your work. In fact, chores and daily routines (such as exercising) help you to attain a sense of stability in your day. You could say they anchor you.\n",
    "As number 4, you may feel a little unhinged without these daily routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working towards a goal**\n",
    "You have a strong desire to always be working towards a goal.\n",
    "This is a great quality which can help you achieve many things. (Especially compared to the more wild and creative types.)\n",
    "Your goals tend to be down-to-earth which makes them even more achievable. You may not have a vision that sets others aflame, but you do notice every detail.\n",
    "You are happy to blend into your surroundings without drawing much attention to yourself. You’re not huge into socialising and prefer to leave the spotlight to others. But if anyone tries to step into your territory, your need for control and order will be under threat. It is is important that you also take the time to relax. Your partner, family or loved one will especially appreciate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perfectionism**\n",
    "This soul urge number expresses many wonderful practical characteristics.\n",
    "But it also means that you may have a tendency towards perfectionism. This is because you have such a strong desire to create order and stability in life. Sometimes you are so engrossed in this that you forget the bigger picture.\n",
    "You may get too carried away with establishing order in trivial things. For example, you may invest huge amounts of energy in things like cleaning the house in a particular way. Or rigidly following the rules of a new recipe. This is because you detest sudden change.\n",
    "For you, rules represent freedom.\n",
    "By following rules and doing things in a certain way, you create the stability that your soul craves.\n",
    "Your desire for rules can also manifest in less helpful aspects of life.\n",
    "For example, you may become rigid or too conservative in your views, which can inhibit others. While others value your reliability, living with someone with heart’s desire number 4 can be challenging at times.\n",
    "Not everyone associates rules and order with freedom. You need to recognise that others have a different approach to life. Allow them to express all aspects themselves, even if they seem chaotic to you.\n",

    "However, you may struggle with expressing your deep feelings. Soul urge 4 expresses practicality and materialism, and feelings are not tangible. They may baffle you at times.\n",
    "For many of you, love is expressed through practical actions. But what you need to realise is that this may not be the same for others. Often people need to be told that they are loved. Your loved one may not actually be aware of how much you care for them. And with children especially you need to find ways to express the deep love you feel toward them in your heart.'''"

Those with soul urge number 5 tend to flick from one project to the next, without finishing any one of them. That may be because the process is more interesting for you than the end result.\n",

    "Once you do find the right partner, you’ll remain loyal to them. But they will still need to accept the strong desire for freedom that soul urge number 5 expresses.\n",
    "For example, you may want to do your own thing on a weekend. You may struggle taking up responsibilities and commitments that others expect in relationships. The dream of a ‘white picket fence’ is not for you.\n",
    "Your loved ones cherish your enthusiasm, your tolerance of others and alternative lifestyles. There is never a dull moment in your company! But you need to recognise that the demands which they seem to place on you are not designed to inhibit you.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Picking a career**\n",
    "For a dynamic force such as soul urge number 5, it can be very difficult to settle into one particular career.\n",
    "You’re very comfortable with change, and you adapt quickly to new environments. You may be drawn towards career decisions that involve the opportunity to travel.\n",
    "You’re not particularly interested in acquiring material things. As a 5, you’re much more interested in discovering new ideas and new ways of looking at the world. An authoritarian setting, a constrictive work environment or a boss who tries to limit your freedom will not do for you.\n",
    "The main challenge for 5s, when it comes to careers, is picking one and sticking with it. Once you do, your remarkable energy and dynamic presence will help you climb the ladder fast. Try to work for a cause or an employer who cultivates your passion and gives you ample freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Communication with others**\n",
    "You’re a real people’s person, never short for words.\n",
    "People generally feel very comfortable around you. You are very entertaining. You are well-liked but you tend to wear your heart on your sleeve, 5.\n",
    "Be careful who you trust! Your openness is what draws people to you. But sometimes you may misjudge motives and place your trust in the wrong people. People with hearts desire 5 are less likely to join cults and follow dogmas or political parties. But you may be particularly drawn to misfits of society and the eccentric types.'''"
